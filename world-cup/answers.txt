Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

in the beginning with N = 10, Japan had a 30.0% chance of winning, but as the simulations increased, it's winning percentage decreaded, with N = 1000000, it had only 7% chance of winning.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

Both N = 100000 and N = 1000000 are giving the same results, hence i would say 10000 is a good number of simulations.
