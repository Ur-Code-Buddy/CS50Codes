Characterizing the Audio Aura:
I would characterize the listener's audio aura based on the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs from 2018.
If the average energy is high, the music might be intense and active. A high average valence suggests a positive and happy musical content.
A high average danceability indicates music suitable for dancing.

Limitations and Hypotheses:
Given my limited knowledge of songs, this method may not be fully representative.
It might overlook the diversity in the listener's music preferences, as certain genres or specific songs could disproportionately influence the averages.
Additionally, the method doesn't consider the order or sequence of songs, potentially missing nuances in mood transitions.


Considering my limited knowledge, I dont know about specific improvements.
However, Im guessing that perhaps we could explore advanced statistical methods, machine learning models,
or incorporate additional features such as tempo, key, and instrumentalness to enhance the accuracy and representativeness of the audio aura calculation.
Consulting with specialists in the field would likely yield more effective and informed approaches.
